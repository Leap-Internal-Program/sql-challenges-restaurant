## SQL Code Challenges
Do the SQL challenges in the first chapter: *In the Restaurant.*  The second chapter: *At the Library* includes challenges for using join tables.  This activity *does not* include chapter 2 as join tables have not been reviewed as a class.

At the end of the lesson, you should be able to write a SQL query for creating records, returning records, updating recordings, and deleting records from a database. Continue practicing until you feel comfortable with performing these four Crud Operations.

Some of the challenges require SQL concepts that may not have been previously covered, including 
- Keywords LIKE, COUNT
- Datetime field
- Foreign key

There are a total of twelve challenges in the first chapter outlined in the table below. 

If a problem is listed as *do it* you should complete this challenge through reviewing the previous training material.

If a problem is listed as *try it* you should try to complete the challenge through reviewing previous material, but the concepts in the problem may not have been explicitly covered.  You may want to peek at the solution.

If a problem is listed as *copy Scott's solution*, think about how you would approach the solution, but you need knowledge not yet covered in classs to solve the problem.  After thinking through the challenge, watch and try to understand his solution.

There are a total of twelve challenges in the first chapter outlined in the table below.
